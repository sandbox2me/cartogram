Cartogram
====

A fast 2D WebGL rendering engine. Under the hood Cartogram uses ThreeJS, merges all your meshes, and handles interactions.

Disclaimer
----

While Cartogram is in production for us we realize the learning curve is high and some things would be hard to use. We are aiming to make it more easily usable for everyone eventually. Right now we think people would find it useful to learn how we created some of our basic objects.

Roadmap
----

- Make the repo usable across various module systems
- Remove dependence on threeJS, backbone, underscore, requirejs, etc
- Add ReactJS bindings

Setup
-----
- To install and build: `npm install`
- To run tests: `npm run test`
- To build in dev mode: `npm run watch` then go to http://localhost:8081/examples/interactive.html
